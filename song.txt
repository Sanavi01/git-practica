One more day we'll spend together
Lay your eyes, look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars to make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But my love, I won't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the Sun, I'll be the waves
I'll be the one you love the most
